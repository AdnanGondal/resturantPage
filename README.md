## About

This is a webpage for a conceptual restaurant, created via CSS,  Bootstrap, and JavaScript. 

DOM manipulation has been used to dynamically render this page; the majority of the content is created by JS alone. 

Different components of the page have been separated into ES6 modules. Webpack has been used to compile the modules together to give the distribution code. 


## Usage

The site has been deployed to Github Pages and can be accessed via:

## Project status

Development on this project has been put to a stop.
